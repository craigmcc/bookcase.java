## Book Catalog based on Wildfly + Microprofile + GraphQL

This is a simple book catalog to keep track of a library of books,
spread across different media types, where many of the books are also a
part of collections (also called "box sets" or "anthologies").  In
addition, books can optionally be categoried as part of a series.
